  COVER_LETTER:
    "Hi Im Prateek Bhatnagar, I'm a Full Stack software developer, With about 5 years of experience working for med tech startups in California. " +
    "At my core I believe my exceptional ability is centred around understanding humans and their behaviour not only as it relates to technology but also in general life. I think this understanding is key to creating highly usable and intuitive user interfaces, it's why user experiences like 'drag and drop' feel so natural. This key understanding is what helped me design and create user experiences for medical devices, a field littered with archaic interfaces created solely with functionality in mind. My experience creating UIs for these devices not only involved modernising and upgrading the underlying tech but also delivering a user experience that allows for the execution of extremely complex tasks with assistance from AI and other intelligence components and facilitate advanced decision making for the user. " +
    "I did my masters from Johns Hopkins in Computer Science and I have created UIs using React for 3 different 510k medical devices with complex operation tasks, with great attention to detail and usability being a key factor at 2 different small startup teams so my experience spans across the stack and through testing and building out cloud services on AWS as well. Additionally I have experience and expertise in representing complex data such as time series and 3D models using libraries like D3js and threejs. I worked for few years at Avenda Health working on a medical device for Prostate Cancer Treatment and a cloud based treatment planning system(Multiple microservices on aws to create a single treatment planning portal) - the stack here was GO, Python and React ,Nodejs, Jest,Selenium, RabbitMQ, Flask, MongoDB. Both these projects were shipped and got 510k clearance and one got breakthrough. I now work at Vektor medical on an Arrhythmia mapping medical device system, also 510k cleared, with a Jest,Selenium, FastApi, SQL and Firestore,Python and React stack with nodejs and Typescript. " +
    "Additionally I understand the importance of UI in user decision making and habits and also simplifying complex decisions for users using UI and UX. " +
    "Due to my med tech experience I create highly tested ,documented and readable code",
