<h2>Project Portfolio</h2>
<p>Here is a showcase of some of the projects I have done.These projects cover my various research interests namely - Networking, Computer Vision, Internet Of Things and Artificial Intelligence</p>
<h3>Jeeves - Voice Activated Home Automation</h3>
<p>The system consists of an Arduino connected to various home appliances[Illustrated in this case using LEDs]. The system has an accompanying mobile app that connects to the hardware over bluetooth. The app converts the user's voice input into text ;using the Google Voice API;and tranfers it over to the Arduino where the string is parsed(Some simple Natural Language Processing) and the appropriate action is taken i.e. the appropriate appliance is turned on/off.</p>
